    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p class="subtitle">KR8TIV AI — KIN Service</p>
    <p class="effective">Effective Date: February 20, 2026 &nbsp;|&nbsp; Last Updated: February 20, 2026</p>

    <div class="notice">
        <strong>⚠️ Business Registration Notice</strong>
        <p>KR8TIV AI is not currently a registered business entity. We are operating as a sole proprietorship under the name Aurora Ventures dba KR8TIV AI. We intend to formally register the business in the near future as revenue allows. This does not affect the binding nature of these Terms — by using the Service, you agree to all terms herein regardless of our registration status.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="disclaimer-box">
        <strong>⚠️ Not Legal Advice</strong>
        <p>This Terms of Service is a professional template synthesized from verified industry standards as of February 2026. It is <strong>not legal advice</strong>. It has been modeled after terms from OpenAI, Anthropic, xAI, and other leading AI providers. We recommend consulting a qualified attorney for jurisdiction-specific guidance.</p>
    </div>

    <!-- Section 1 -->
    <h2><span class="num">01</span> Agreement to Terms</h2>
    <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") constitute a legally binding agreement between you (the "User," "you," or "your") and Aurora Ventures dba KR8TIV AI and its affiliates ("KR8TIV," "we," "us," or "our"), governing your access to and use of the KIN service, including bespoke AI companions ("KIN"), concierge features, computer-control automation via OpenClaw infrastructure, VPS hosting, API integrations (Anthropic, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, OpenAI, etc.), Solana-based Genesis NFTs, and all related tools, websites, and applications (collectively, the "Service").</p>
    <p>By accessing, minting, subscribing to, or using the Service in any way, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by these Terms. If you do not agree, you must immediately cease all use of the Service.</p>

    <!-- Section 2 -->
    <h2><span class="num">02</span> Description of Service</h2>
    <p>The Service provides managed AI companions (KIN) that can chat, automate tasks, control computers (with your explicit permission), manage calendars, emails, investments, and perform concierge functions. Genesis NFTs grant lifetime discounts and ecosystem rewards but do not alter these Terms.</p>
    <p>We strive for reliability and privacy but make no guarantees. All KIN instances are siloed — we do not use your personal data to train public models or sell it to third parties.</p>

    <!-- Section 3 -->
    <h2><span class="num">03</span> User Eligibility and Accounts</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>You must be at least <strong>18 years old</strong> (or the age of majority in your jurisdiction) and capable of forming a binding contract.</li>
        <li>You are responsible for all activity under your account and must keep credentials secure.</li>
        <li>We may suspend or terminate accounts for violations or suspected risk at our sole discretion.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 4 -->
    <h2><span class="num">04</span> Fees, Payments, and Billing</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Subscriptions are billed monthly in advance.</li>
        <li>Genesis mints are one-time Solana payments.</li>
        <li>All fees are <strong>non-refundable</strong> except where required by applicable law or as explicitly stated (e.g., mint refund guarantee).</li>
        <li>We may change prices with 30 days' notice.</li>
        <li>Late payments may result in suspension of service.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 5 -->
    <h2><span class="num">05</span> Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>We retain all rights to the Service, underlying models, OpenClaw infrastructure, and KIN personalities. You own your inputs and may use outputs for personal purposes, subject to these Terms. You grant us a limited license to process your data solely to provide the Service and concierge support.</p>

    <!-- Section 6 -->
    <h2 id="privacy"><span class="num">06</span> Privacy and Data Practices</h2>
    <p>We are committed to privacy. Your KIN instance is <strong>siloed</strong> and not used for training public models. We access data only with your permission for concierge fixes or support.</p>
    <p>We do not sell or share personal data with third parties. We employ reasonable security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, and <strong>we cannot guarantee absolute security</strong>.</p>
    <p>We do our absolute best to preserve everybody's privacy, but we are not liable for privacy violations arising from third-party services (API providers, VPS hosts, Solana network), unauthorized access beyond our reasonable control, or actions you authorize your KIN to perform.</p>
    <p>By using the Service, you acknowledge and accept these inherent risks of cloud-based AI systems.</p>

    <!-- Section 7 -->
    <h2><span class="num">07</span> Acceptable Use and Prohibited Conduct</h2>
    <p>You may use the Service only for lawful, personal, or authorized business purposes. Prohibited activities include (but are not limited to):</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Using KIN for illegal acts, fraud, or harm.</li>
        <li>Relying on KIN outputs for unlicensed professional advice (legal, medical, financial, etc.) without independent verification by a qualified professional.</li>
        <li>Granting KIN access to systems without ongoing human supervision.</li>
        <li>Reverse engineering, scraping, or competing with the Service.</li>
        <li>Any high-stakes automated decisions affecting safety, legal rights, or finances without explicit human review and approval.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Section 8 -->
    <h2><span class="num">08</span> AI Outputs, Actions, and Computer Control — Critical Disclaimers</h2>
    <p>KIN uses frontier AI models that are probabilistic and may produce inaccurate, incomplete, biased, or hallucinatory outputs. Computer-control features (browser automation, payments, code execution, wallet management, etc.) carry inherent risks including financial loss, data corruption, security breaches, or unintended actions.</p>

    <div class="caps">
        YOU ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT:
        <ul style="text-transform:none; font-weight:400; margin-top:1rem;">
            <li>All KIN suggestions, drafts, automations, and actions are for informational or assistive purposes only.</li>
            <li>You must independently review, verify, and explicitly authorize every material action (e.g., payments, investments, code deployment, file modifications).</li>
            <li>We are not responsible for any errors, omissions, or consequences arising from KIN outputs or actions, even if performed under concierge service.</li>
            <li>Use of the Service for financial transactions, investments, or critical decisions is at your sole risk and may result in irreversible loss.</li>
            <li>Artificial intelligence is evolving; outputs may not reflect real facts, current laws, or your intent.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
