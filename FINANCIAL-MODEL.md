## THE TOKEN FLYWHEEL

This is the real play. The 20% ops looks thin, but:

| KR8TIV Token Ownership | Effective Capture of Total Profit |
|---|---|
| 8% (today) | 20% + (8% × 75%) = **26%** |
| 15% (month 6-8) | 20% + (15% × 75%) = **31.25%** |
| 25% (year 1 optimistic) | 20% + (25% × 75%) = **38.75%** |
| 40% (year 2 target) | 20% + (40% × 75%) = **50%** |
| 51% (majority) | 20% + (51% × 75%) = **58.25%** |

Every dollar into the token ecosystem that KR8TIV holds = value captured.
At 40% ownership, KR8TIV effectively keeps 50 cents of every profit dollar.

## ADDITIONAL REVENUE STREAMS (Not Fully Modeled)

| Stream | Timeline | Potential |
|---|---|---|
| Enterprise AI employees | Month 4-6 | $2,500-10,000/mo per contract |
| OpenClaw fork (KR8TIV OS) | Month 9-12 | Licensing or SaaS |
| AI lessons/courses | Month 3+ | $500-2,000/mo passive |
| White-label KIN for agencies | Month 6+ | $1,000-5,000/mo per partner |
| Blockchain identity (on-chain KIN) | Year 2 | Transaction fees |
| Plush toys / merchandise | Year 2 | Physical product revenue |
| Secondary mint collections | Year 1+ | Additional mints (no rev share) |
| Rebinding fees | Ongoing | $149/trade |

## REALITY CHECK

**What makes this work:**
- Mint provides real runway ($13-18K net)
- Token flywheel increases effective capture over time
- Enterprise is the 10x lever (way higher margins, way higher revenue)
- Public customers at full price are the volume play
- Multiple revenue streams compound

**What could kill it:**
- If nobody mints (marketing is everything)
- If support costs eat margins (automate HARD)
- If churn is higher than modeled (retention = product quality)
- If you don't accumulate tokens fast enough
- If you spend the mint cash on non-revenue things

**The 20% ops concern:**
Early months, 20% of profit is thin. But costs are covered BEFORE the split. The 20% is reinvestment/salary money. As revenue scales, 20% of $60K/mo profit = $12K/mo. Plus token capture. It compounds.
